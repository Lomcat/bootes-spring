## 2.1 Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control

A Java application — a loose term that runs the gamut from constrained, embedded applications to n-tier, server-side enterprise applications — typically consists of objects that collaborate to form the application proper. Thus the objects in an application have_dependencies_on each other.

Although the Java platform provides a wealth of application development functionality, it lacks the means to organize the basic building blocks into a coherent whole, leaving that task to architects and developers. Although you can use design patterns such as_Factory_,_Abstract Factory_,_Builder_,_Decorator_, and_Service Locator_to compose the various classes and object instances that make up an application, these patterns are simply that: best practices given a name, with a description of what the pattern does, where to apply it, the problems it addresses, and so forth. Patterns are formalized best practices that_you must implement yourself_in your application.

The Spring Framework_Inversion of Control_\(IoC\) component addresses this concern by providing a formalized means of composing disparate components into a fully working application ready for use. The Spring Framework codifies formalized design patterns as first-class objects that you can integrate into your own application\(s\). Numerous organizations and institutions use the Spring Framework in this manner to engineer robust,_maintainable_applications.

> **Background**
> 
> "_The question is, what aspect of control are \[they\] inverting?_" Martin Fowler posed this question about Inversion of Control \(IoC\)[on his site](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)in 2004. Fowler suggested renaming the principle to make it more self-explanatory and came up with_Dependency Injection_.
