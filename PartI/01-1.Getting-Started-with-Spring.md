## 1. Getting Started with Spring

This reference guide provides detailed information about the Spring Framework. It provides comprehensive documentation for all features, as well as some background about the underlying concepts \(such as_"Dependency Injection"_\) that Spring has embraced.

If you are just getting started with Spring, you may want to begin using the Spring Framework by creating a[Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)based application. Spring Boot provides a quick \(and opinionated\) way to create a production-ready Spring based application. It is based on the Spring Framework, favors convention over configuration, and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

You can use[start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io/)to generate a basic project or follow one of the["Getting Started" guides](https://spring.io/guides)like the[Getting Started Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)one. As well as being easier to digest, these guides are very_task focused_, and most of them are based on Spring Boot. They also cover other projects from the Spring portfolio that you might want to consider when solving a particular problem.

## 1. Spring 入门

本参考指南介绍了 Spring 框架的详细信息。提供 Spring 所有功能的全面文档，以及一些相关底层概念（如“依赖注入”）的背景资料。

如果刚接触 Spring，可以通过创建一个基于 [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) 应用来开始使用 Spring 框架。Spring Boot 是 Spring 框架“约定优于配置”的实现，舍弃了繁琐的 XML 配置，旨在助你尽快地将应用运行起来。

你可以使用 [start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io/) 或按照一个类似 [Getting Started Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/) 这样的 [入门指南](https://spring.io/guides) 来生成一个基本工程。这些指南介绍的内容都很专一，比较容易理解，其中大部分基于 Spring Boot 。另外他们中还涵盖了一些解决特定问题的 Spring 组合示例。
