### 2.2.5 Web

The_Web_layer consists of the`spring-web`,`spring-webmvc`and`spring-websocket`modules.

The`spring-web`module provides basic web-oriented integration features such as multipart file upload functionality and the initialization of the IoC container using Servlet listeners and a web-oriented application context. It also contains an HTTP client and the web-related parts of Spring’s remoting support.

The`spring-webmvc`module \(also known as the_Web-Servlet_module\) contains Spring’s model-view-controller \([_MVC_](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.M4/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-introduction)\) and REST Web Services implementation for web applications. Spring’s MVC framework provides a clean separation between domain model code and web forms and integrates with all of the other features of the Spring Framework.
