### 3.2.3 Using the container

The`ApplicationContext`is the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining a registry of different beans and their dependencies. Using the method`T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType)`you can retrieve instances of your beans.

The`ApplicationContext`enables you to read bean definitions and access them as follows:

```java
// create and configure beans
ApplicationContext context =
	new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[] {"services.xml", "daos.xml"});

// retrieve configured instance
PetStoreService service = context.getBean("petStore", PetStoreService.class);

// use configured instance
List<String> userList = service.getUsernameList();
```

You use `getBean()` to retrieve instances of your beans. The `ApplicationContext` interface has a few other methods for retrieving beans, but ideally your application code should never use them. Indeed, your application code should have no calls to the `getBean()` method at all, and thus no dependency on Spring APIs at all. For example, Spring’s integration with web frameworks provides for dependency injection for various web framework classes such as controllers and JSF-managed beans.
